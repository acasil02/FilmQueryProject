# FilmQueryProject

## Project for Skill Distillery

## Description
This is a Film Query App made to be able to find films with user inputs. The user will be prompt to enter a film id, film keyword or a quit option. These options then searches through all of the list of films containing the certain inputs entered. The output will then print out the film's title, release year, rating, description, language and the list of actors for the film.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use a command line with SQL queries to search though a database and get the information. This also helped me understand how to pull exact information from the database and output it to display.
